Driven by bullocks , Here the wooden ghani remains the same, but the electric motor replace the animal . Means of Aayurveda the wood use in the churner is also made of selected like Neem, Vagai, Temarind and Mango Tree as suggested by Aayurveda Rishis.

                           <p>Sri Shanmuga  Oil Mill was started by Former professor, Mr.Prabhu at 1985 & running successfully for over 25 years. Initially He started with 4 types of oils like Sesame oil, Coconut oil, Groundnut oil & Castor Oil. 
                           we follow an ancient technique of extracting oil from various seeds by Wooden ghani and Rotary. No Chemical is used while Extracting the oil and Especially no Machine Filter Process is done Because it again Requires Heat above Smoke (Boiling) Point, we perform Manual filter process just settle down the oil for 12 hours so Thus it is Thick as compared to Refined oil and full of Natural Values so the Taste, Colour, and Smell of the oil Remain unchanged Like Garden Fresh. </p>

                              <p>I first started using Shanmuga Oil after listening and reading about from all the corners. Though I was bit skeptical at the start since my family is a stickler to their preferences for taste. So when I first cooked in our Oil, I didn't tell them. I have been using it more than a year now and everybody in family loves it. Thank You to him.</p>

After experimenting with many brands available in the market, I stumbled on Shanmuga oil and my salads stared tasting Indian. And that's because shanmuga oil is imported from anywhere in india. I really recommended to everyone for our shanmuga oil.</p>
